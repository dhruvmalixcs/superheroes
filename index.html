                <h2>The Batman 2022</h2>
                <p>The opening shots of this movie are really intended to instill fear within you. We are immediately introduced and thrust into the world of Gotham City, how it mirrors New York City almost perfectly, and especially within the crime of the world. There are robberies, graffiti, and beatings going down everywhere across the city. 

                    It seems to be complete and utter chaos until we see what these criminals are all afraid of: the bat signal in the sky. They look to dark alleys, spaces where Batman could easily emerge to take them down, and the audience can be fooled into thinking he’ll just appear at any minute because of how ominous these spaces are. 
                    
                    He appears at a subway station, however, to stop a group of clown-faced thugs from beating up a businessman. At the same time, the Mayor has been murdered by someone called the Riddler and James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) brings the Batman to the scene of the crime. This Batman is very analytical; he uses forensics and basic calculations and deductions to figure out the cryptograms the killer leaves behind. We see more of this when he returns to his tower in the city, where he lives with a maid and his family’s butler.
